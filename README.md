# Equality-Constrained Quadratic Programming Solver and Portfolio Optimization

### Aim of the Project

This repository implements and benchmarks a suite of solvers for a specific class of equality-constrained quadratic programs (QP). The goal is to analyze the trade-offs between direct, iterative, and reduced-space methods for solving large-scale optimization problems, with a practical application in portfolio optimization.

### Methodologies Implemented

Four distinct solver strategies based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions were implemented and compared:

* **Dense Direct KKT**: Constructs and solves the full `(n+K) x (n+K)` KKT system using direct LU factorization.
* **Iterative KKT (GMRES)**: Solves the sparse KKT system iteratively using the Generalized Minimal Residual method, tested with and without a simple diagonal preconditioner.
* **Schur Complement Reduction**: Eliminates the primal variable `x` and solves a smaller `K x K` system for the dual variable `Î»`, using both direct and iterative (CG) approaches.
* **Null-Space Method**: Eliminates equality constraints by projecting the problem onto the null space of the constraint matrix `A` and solving a smaller, unconstrained QP.

### Key Findings

* **Accuracy vs. Scalability:** **Dense Direct** and **Null-Space** methods are the most accurate (residuals < $10^{-15}$) but are computationally expensive $(O({n^3}))$ and only feasible for $n \le 2000$.
* **Iterative Performance:** **GMRES** is memory-efficient and fast for large $n$, but its accuracy degrades as the problem size increases. The non-preconditioned version often outperformed the simple diagonal preconditioner.
* **Best Trade-Off:** **Schur Complement** methods offer the best balance. The sparse, iterative version (Schur-sp) is extremely fast for large $n$ but less accurate, while the banded version (Schur-band) maintains good accuracy at a moderate cost.

### Application Example: Portfolio Optimization ðŸ“ˆ

The notebook includes a practical finance application to solve the **long-only minimum-variance portfolio problem**

* **Process**: Fetches S&P 100 stock data, estimates the covariance matrix `Î£`, and solves the QP: $\min w^\top \Sigma w$ subject to $1^\top w=1, w \ge 0$.
* **Evaluation**: The performance of portfolios generated by the custom KKT solvers is compared against the `cvxopt` solver, showing competitive out-of-sample annual returns.
