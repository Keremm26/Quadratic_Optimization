# Equality-Constrained Quadratic Programming Solver

### Aim of the Project

This repository implements and benchmarks a suite of solvers for a specific class of equality-constrained quadratic programs (QP). The goal is to analyze the trade-offs between direct, iterative, and reduced-space methods for solving large-scale optimization problems, with a practical application in portfolio optimization.

### Methodologies Implemented

Four distinct solver strategies based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions were implemented and compared:

* **Dense Direct KKT**: Constructs and solves the full `(n+K) x (n+K)` KKT system using direct LU factorization.
* **Iterative KKT (GMRES)**: Solves the sparse KKT system iteratively using the Generalized Minimal Residual method, tested with and without a simple diagonal preconditioner.
* **Schur Complement Reduction**: Eliminates the primal variable `x` and solves a smaller `K x K` system for the dual variable `λ`, using both direct and iterative (CG) approaches.
* **Null-Space Method**: Eliminates equality constraints by projecting the problem onto the null space of the constraint matrix `A` and solving a smaller, unconstrained QP.

### Key Findings

* [cite_start]**Accuracy vs. Scalability**: **Dense Direct** and **Null-Space** methods are the most accurate (residuals `< 10⁻¹⁵`) but are computationally expensive ($O(n³)$) and only feasible for `n ≤ 2000`[cite: 186, 192].
* **Iterative Performance**: **GMRES** is memory-efficient and fast for large `n`, but its accuracy degrades as the problem size increases. [cite_start]The non-preconditioned version often outperformed the simple diagonal preconditioner[cite: 97, 186, 187].
* **Best Trade-Off**: **Schur Complement** methods offer the best balance. [cite_start]The sparse, iterative version (`Schur-sp`) is extremely fast for large `n` but less accurate, while the banded version (`Schur-band`) maintains good accuracy at a moderate cost[cite: 132, 189].

### Application Example: Portfolio Optimization 📈

[cite_start]The notebook includes a practical finance application to solve the **long-only minimum-variance portfolio problem**[cite: 195].

* [cite_start]**Process**: Fetches S&P 100 stock data, estimates the covariance matrix `Σ`, and solves the QP: $\min w^\top \Sigma w$ subject to $1^\top w=1, w \ge 0$[cite: 199, 204].
* [cite_start]**Evaluation**: The performance of portfolios generated by the custom KKT solvers is compared against the `cvxopt` solver, showing competitive out-of-sample annual returns[cite: 265].
